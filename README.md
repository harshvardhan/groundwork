# groundwork

Extract contextual foundations from your codebase for debugging and LLM interactions. Build solid ground for code understanding.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Groundwork?

Like a solid foundation is crucial for building, proper context is essential for understanding code. Groundwork helps you:
- Build consolidated views of your code modules
- Map code dependencies and relationships
- Create rich context for LLM interactions
- Support efficient debugging workflows

## âš¡ Key Features

- **Context Builder**: Consolidate relevant source files into clear, organized snapshots
- **Dependency Mapper**: Trace code relationships from any starting point
- **Smart Filtering**: Focus on relevant code by excluding build files, tests, and generated code
- **Performance Focused**: Handle large codebases efficiently with memory management and caching
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Unix-like systems
- **LLM-Optimized**: Generate context in formats that work naturally with LLMs
